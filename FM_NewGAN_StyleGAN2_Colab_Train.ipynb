        "1.   When referring to a path on your drive and there is spaces in the folder name for example a folder called \"My Folder\" - you must refer to this as My\\ Folder. the \"\\\" indicates the space is not a break in the code\n",
        "2.   Try not to play around this the code too much, my understanding is vague and I wont be able to problem solve individual issues\n",
        "3.   Google Colab has issues. It times out, it has a capacity which based on the number of uses can max out and then randomly just disconnect you, so monitor it often\n",
        "4. You can't close the tab or your computer while performing this training\n",
        "5. You must mount your drive every time and select tensorflow 1.x every time. Installing the Repo isnt a must every time but if you are getting errors, reinstalling it sometimes helps. Often its just google colab being temperamental.\n",
